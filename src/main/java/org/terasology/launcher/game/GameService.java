/**
 * This service starts and monitors the game process.
 * <p>
 * Its {@linkplain #GameService() constructor} requires no arguments. Use {@link #start(Installation, LauncherSettings)} to
 * start the game process; the zero-argument form of {@code start()} will not have enough information.
 * <p>
 * The Boolean value of this service is true when it believes the game process has started <em>successfully.</em>
 * There will be some time between when this service is started and when that value is set. It can be observed on
 * {@link #valueProperty()} or retrieved as {@link #getValue()}.
 * <p>
 * The {@link Worker} interface of this Service provides a proxy to its current {@link RunGameTask}.
 * Many of the methods the Worker interface defines are not used by this task type. In particular, the
 * {@link Worker#progressProperty() progress} and {@link Worker#workDoneProperty() workDone} properties have no
 * information for you that reflect the state of the game process.
 * <p>
 * This service will be in {@link State#RUNNING RUNNING} state as long as the game process is live. It enters
 * {@link State#SUCCEEDED SUCCEEDED} after the game process exits with no error code, or {@link State#FAILED FAILED} if
 * the game failed to start or it terminates with an error. Whether it succeeded or failed, the service will then
 * reset to {@link State#READY READY} to be started again.
 * <p>
 * This service {@linkplain #cancel() does not support cancellation}.
 * <ul>
 *   <li>For details on how the arguments to the process are constructed, see the source for {@link GameStarter}.
 *   <li>For details on how output from the game process is treated, see {@link RunGameTask}.
